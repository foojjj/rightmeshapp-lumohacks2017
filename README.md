The application is the client application to a client-master application setup. The client application takes an encoded string and creates an questionnaire to be answered by the user. The results are then sent back to the master application. The master application is available in the github repository as a zip file. Some of the operations to be implemented include saving data to a database, as well as displaying helpful and relevant resources.

This is work done for Lumohacks 2017 a 24h hackathon. Also our first time with android development. A lot of the code is modified from
the Rightmesh HelloMesh app.
